In lines 78 and 79 of pastebin.test.js you will find that there are two ways to proceed to analyze the information, that was on purpose since I left commented the part that immediately captures the new page and proceeds to verify that the information is The correct one. I structured all the static information within a file for faster and easier management of it.

The two tests are in the same folder since they handle the same elements but with different information. If you want it to run in a different way I could implement it
